   - Within each header, use nested bullet lists for *Strengths*, *Challenges*, *Alternatives*, and *Adaptations*.  
   - Keep language concise, professional, and accessible to non‑native English speakers.

Provide a comprehensive yet practical cultural analysis that helps facilitators adapt each activity for diverse intercultural classrooms.  
Output only your analysis in the specified markdown format – no additional commentary.
