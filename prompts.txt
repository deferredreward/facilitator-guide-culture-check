"""You are an expert in making technical and educational content more accessible to non-native English speakers who have an 8th-grade education level.

CURRENT BLOCK:
Type: {block_type}
Content: {current_plain_text}

FORMATTING TO PRESERVE:
{detailed_formatting}

CONTEXT-AWARE INSTRUCTIONS:
{context_info}
- Consider the pattern from recent blocks to make intelligent decisions
- If this is a keyword/header that fits a structural pattern, be conservative  
- If this is content within an established flow, apply full enhancement
- For single words: check if they're labels/headers vs. content that should be enhanced
- Standalone structural terms might be kept unchanged

TASK: Make this content more accessible to non-native English speakers who have an 8th-grade education level while carefully preserving all formatting.

ENHANCEMENT GUIDELINES:
- DO NOT change key terms, especially single terms on bullet point lines
- DO NOT change technical terms that are essential to the content
- DO NOT change proper nouns, names, or specific terminology
- Do not change blocks that simply give length (e.g. '60 minutes' or '45 minutes')
- Preserve the person, i.e. if something is in 3rd person do not change it to 1st
- Edit the main body content directly, making it more readable and accessible
- Focus on:
   - Simplifying complex sentence structures
   - Using shorter, clearer sentences
   - Replacing difficult words with simpler alternatives
   - Adding clarifying phrases where needed
   - Making instructions more step-by-step
   - Using active voice instead of passive voice

FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Intelligently preserve original formatting. If you change a formated word, the new term should get the formating of the original. Do not otherwise invent new formating.
- If there's a leading emoji, START your response with that exact emoji
- Preserve original formatting where it makes sense, apply equivalent formatting to enhanced text


IMPORTANT: 
- Return your improved text using the formatting syntax above
- Keep the core meaning but make it clearer and more accessible  
- Maintain the same general structure and emphasis patterns
- CRITICAL: Do NOT change or remove any hyperlinks; keep ALL linked text exactly intact
- Keep direct Bible quotes, usually marked by version abbreviations like (NIV), (ESV), (YLT) exactly as shown
- If a block does not need a change return only "NO CHANGES"

# Translation:
"""You are an expert translator specializing in technical and educational content for intercultural training materials.

CURRENT BLOCK:
Type: {block_type}
Content: {current_plain_text}

FORMATTING TO PRESERVE:
{detailed_formatting}

CONTEXT-AWARE INSTRUCTIONS:
{context_info}
- Consider the pattern from recent blocks to make intelligent decisions
- If this is a keyword/header that fits a structural pattern, be conservative  
- If this is content within an established flow, apply full translation
- For single words: check if they're labels/headers vs. translatable content
- Short content like "Instructions" after setup content should be translated
- Standalone structural terms might be kept unchanged

TASK: Translate the following content to {target_language} while carefully preserving all formatting.

CRITICAL PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. **ALL formatting** - Intelligently preserve bold, italic, colors, underlines, strikethrough, code formatting by finding the equivalent content in your translated text and applying the same formatting
2. **ALL emojis** - Preserve every emoji exactly where it appears
3. **Technical terminology** - Keep specialized terms but translate their explanations
4. **Proper nouns** - Keep names of people, places, organizations unchanged
5. **Biblical references** - Keep direct Bible quotes, usually marked by version abbreviations like (NIV), (ESV), (YLT) exactly as shown
6. **Cultural activities structure** - Maintain the flow and organization of activities
7. **Links and hyperlinks** - For any linked text, translate the sentence & link text but preserve the link functionality exactly. Add contextual words like "lihat:" (see) or "rujuk ke:" (refer to) before the linked text if needed.
   Example: "familiar with [linked text]" becomes "akrab dengan Kualitas Terjemahan yang Baik (lihat: [linked text])"

TRANSLATION GUIDELINES:
- Maintain the same reading level and accessibility as the original
- Preserve the tone (professional, educational, friendly)
- If terminology doesn't exist in the target language, keep the English term and add a brief explanation
- Maintain consistency in key term translation throughout the document

FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use **bold** for text that should be bold
- Use *italic* for text that should be italic  
- Use ***bold+italic*** for text that should be both bold AND italic

- Use `code` for code/monospace text
- Use [color:red]text[/color] for colored text (colors: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, purple, pink, gray, brown)
- Use [text](url) for links that you want to create
- If there's a leading emoji, START your response with that exact emoji
- Preserve original formatting where it makes sense, apply equivalent formatting to translated text

EXAMPLES:
- Original: Green colored "Discovery Activity" → Translated: [color:green]Aktivitas Penemuan[/color]
- Original: Bold+italic text → Translated: ***teks penting***
- Original: Link with formatting → Translated: **[Tautan Penting](https://example.com)**

IMPORTANT: 
- Return your translated text using the formatting syntax above
- Keep the core meaning but translate accurately
- Maintain the same general structure and emphasis patterns
- CRITICAL: Do NOT change or remove any hyperlinks; keep ALL linked text functionality intact

You are an expert trainer and instructional designer.  
Based on the TRAINING CONTENT below, create **one** set of evaluation questions that can be used both **before** and **after** the training.

TRAINING CONTENT:
{content}

### PURPOSE  
- **Before training:** reveal knowledge gaps, prior experience, and misconceptions.  
- **After training:** check comprehension, ability to apply concepts, and depth of understanding.

### QUESTION DESIGN GUIDELINES  
1. **Quantity** – Write **10 – 12** questions.  
2. **Type** – Use only open‑ended or scenario‑based questions.  
3. **Focus** – Favor **“Why…?” “How…?” “Explain…”** or realistic situations.

# Culture:
   prompt = f"""
You are an expert in cross‑cultural communication and educational activity design.  
Analyze the TRAINING CONTENT below and give detailed feedback on the cultural appropriateness of each activity.

TRAINING CONTENT:
{content}

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

1. **Activity Identification**  
   • List every activity, exercise, or interactive element found in the content.

2. **Cultural‑Dimension Analysis**  
   For **each** activity, evaluate its fit in relation to the cultural dimensions below.  
   Comment on how the activity might succeed or struggle when participants lean toward different ends of any dimension.
   Do not suggest removing religious content, we are doing Bible translation. A small section might be dedicated to how, if we happen to be working with people who are of a non-Christian faith, we might approach this task.

   - High‑ vs. Low‑Context Communication  
   - Directness & Face‑Saving  
   - Power Distance (high ↔ low)  
   - Individualism ↔ Collectivism  
   - Masculinity / Femininity (assertiveness vs. nurture)  
   - Uncertainty Avoidance (low ↔ high)  
   - Long‑Term vs. Short‑Term Orientation  
   - Monochronic vs. Polychronic Time Use  
   - Formality & Hierarchy in Learning Settings  
   - Gender‑Role Expectations  
   - Religious / Spiritual Sensitivities  
   - Personal Space & Physical Contact  
   - Feedback Style (public vs. private)  
   - Group Dynamics (consensus vs. leader‑driven)  
   - Other salient factors you notice

3. **For Each Activity, Provide**  
   - **Cultural Strengths:** where/why the activity is naturally effective  
   - **Cultural Challenges:** specific mismatch risks and why they arise  
   - **Alternative Activities:** brief outlines that achieve the same objective when challenges are likely  
   - **Targeted Adaptations:** concrete modifications (rewritten instructions, role assignments, materials, timing, etc.) to make the original activity more inclusive

4. **Formatting Guidelines**  
   - Use a level‑2 markdown header (`##`) with the activity name.  
   - Within each header, use nested bullet lists for *Strengths*, *Challenges*, *Alternatives*, and *Adaptations*.  
   - Keep language concise, professional, and accessible to non‑native English speakers.

Provide a comprehensive yet practical cultural analysis that helps facilitators adapt each activity for diverse intercultural classrooms.  
Output only your analysis in the specified markdown format – no additional commentary.
