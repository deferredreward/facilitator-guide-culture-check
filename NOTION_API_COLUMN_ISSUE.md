# Notion API Column Structure Issue

## Problem Summary
We're trying to recreate synced block content that includes column layouts, but hitting validation errors with Notion's API when creating `column_list` and `column` blocks.

## Current Status
✅ **Working**: Successfully extracting and rebuilding the hierarchy from synced blocks
✅ **Working**: Converting simple blocks (paragraphs, callouts, etc.)
❌ **Failing**: Creating column structures due to API validation errors

## Latest Error
```
body failed validation: body.children[3].column_list.children[0].column.children should be defined, instead was `undefined`.
```

## What We Know Works
- Extracting 12 blocks recursively from synced source
- Rebuilding block hierarchy from flattened list
- Finding 5 top-level blocks, 4 with children
- Creating column_list with 3 column children
- Each column has its own children (1, 2, 1 respectively)

## Current Structure We're Creating
```javascript
{
  "type": "column_list",
  "column_list": {
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "column",
        "column": {},
        "children": [
          { /* paragraph content */ }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "column", 
        "column": {},
        "children": [
          { /* paragraph content */ },
          { /* more content */ }
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "column",
        "column": {},
        "children": [
          { /* paragraph content */ }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "children": [ /* same 3 columns duplicated here */ ]
}
```

## The Issue
Notion's API validation is failing because:
1. `column_list.children[0].column.children should be defined` - but we have children at the block level
2. We're putting children in both `block.children` AND `block.column_list.children` for column_list
3. But for individual columns, we only have `block.children`, not `block.column.children`

## Questions for Other AIs
1. **Where exactly should children go for column blocks?**
   - At block level: `column_block.children = [...]`
   - In type data: `column_block.column.children = [...]` 
   - Both places?

2. **What's the correct structure for creating nested column layouts via blocks.children.append()?**

3. **Do we need to handle column blocks differently than column_list blocks?**

4. **Are there any special requirements for the `column_list.children` vs block-level `children`?**

## Code Context
We're using Python with notion-client library:
```python
response = notion_client.blocks.children.append(
    block_id=parent_id,
    children=insertable_blocks
)
```

## Debug Output Shows
- Block level children: 3 ✅
- Type data children: 3 ✅  
- Child 0: column with 1 children ✅
- Child 1: column with 2 children ✅
- Child 2: column with 1 children ✅

But API still says `column.children should be defined, instead was undefined`.

## Goal
Successfully recreate synced block content including:
- Videos (links)
- Tables with formatting
- Column layouts with proper nesting
- All other block types

The synced block extraction and hierarchy rebuilding works perfectly - we just need the final API structure to match Notion's expectations exactly.
